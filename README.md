# Portfolio

My original portfolio was written with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and used the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme. While this was a great option for me at the time, I wanted to have a little more control over how things looked. Since then, I've learned a lot more about web development and decided to tackle a redesign from scratch. This website uses the content-focused web framework [Astro](https://astro.build/) and relies on [React](https://react.dev/) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for some custom components.
